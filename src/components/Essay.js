		<p>Cities have, for most of modernity, held the promise of greater access for their residents. The abundance of options about where one lives, works, and shops are just a sampling of the opportunities available to the urban dweller, while those choices may be considerably more limited or homogenous in a sparsely-populated part of the countryside. Each person will feel that the string of preferences are very personal to themselves, even if they are more guided by the structural dictates of capitalism than individual agency. That illusion of choice has recently come into alignment with the invisible operations guiding our online existences, which presented users with similar promises of unfettered accessibility a quarter of a century ago. The resemblance is the unmistakable result of the same extractive processes. Consequently, New York could make an apt metaphor for the internet itself, its collective histories, the biomass of its users, and its decentralized communities. And both present similar challenges to represent, and to preserve, in art. If there didn’t already exist an island where any endeavor to preserve a moment in time assured its destruction, then Casares' Morel would have to invent it. Like <i>David Holzman’s Diary</i>’s attempt to record the entire evening’s news as a barrage of still frames, attempting to focus on everything signifies nothing (and one’s Upper West Side neighbors may be less appreciative of being surveilled). In the exercise of their craft, the painter of urban landscapes may well be practicing woodchops while their pastoral colleagues nonchalantly stock firewood. Their hieroglyph bears an uneasy witness to a vast and ungraspable network.</p>
		<p>What this piece proposes is, by means of restraint, to apply a dynamometer to those aforementioned controlling forces. By imposing certain known variables, we may then measure them with a known formula. In other words, only an algorithm can defuse an algorithm. Once our understanding of our reality is quantified, there is no reversing the process. Randomness is just one possible way of reconfiguring the data to model human consciousness, which is fundamentally chaotic. As will be seen, it may also serve toxicologically useful to examine the effects of randomness on a system that is by nature ataxophobic. Lest the system give in completely to entropy, this operation is non-terminal and merely jump-starts the engine to generate new matrices of associations. Given our tendency to recognize order even in places it does not exist, unexplored detours through the fog of information emerge. Let us now turn to the fuel-guzzlers themselves; the non-human machines of the equation.</p>
		<p>What is meant by quantification? The auxoaction of information technologies in the new millennium has caused a wide range of incompatible subjects to be reclassified as informational data. In addition, it has led us to codify ourselves, the thinking subjects, as machines. In what is now considered a foundational text in the field of posthuman studies, N. Katherine Hayles writes, "[w]hen information loses its body, equating humans and computers is especially easy, for the materiality in which the thinking mind is instantiated appears incidental to its essential nature." Artificial intelligence will never replicate human thought, but its effect on our consciousness is essentially homeopathic; even the epistemic intrusion of the concept restructures our own definition of intelligence into something computational. We become not-so-large language models, very good at classifying culture into typologies, less so at original thought. We might group Days of Rising Doom, the sole recording effort of the German power metal group Aina from the heyday of internet music sharing, with the similar supergroup Avantasia, based on the two bands’ popularity among similar fans for refining the concept of the metal opera and showy guest appearances. If we were thinking like a recommendation algorithm, that is. We would be unlikely to ponder whether the kingdom of Aina is more influenced by Tolkien or King Lear, and still less to consider whether Glenn Hughes’ inositol vocals suggest a hard rock dynasty. Or we may not think any of these things, since at present the album is not available on any music streaming apps. Quantification must have boundaries, which are wherever the data begins and ends.</p>
		<p>Of course, this tendency toward quantification predates the web, though its proliferation is assured in a networked globe. In the art world, despite the acknowledged plurality of artistic styles today, it has become fashionable to put painting into one box or another, in spite of the ideas and experiences informing a practice. Such hierarchical relationships have existed throughout western art history, and today follow tribadic logic: if the Greeks thought it and it’s on the internet, it must be true. (Never mind asking a woman her opinion!) A perceptual phenomena experienced in a particular place at a certain time of day and transmitted by some uncertain means into an object of contemplation will be tagged as landscape, as if that were the main idea represented, making moving on to the next picture as easy as possible. Whereas the untrained eye might be elated to alight on some recognizable detail and praise its fidelity to reality, the artist may choose to eschew this tendency, casting their malediction’s severance of abstraction from representation. But in this refusal is a reification of the existent categorizations passed down through the bloodlines of painters.</p>
		<p>It is indisputable too that people employed randomness in their media consumption habits in the past. One might still prefer the nostalgic pleasures of stumbling upon a movie while flipping through channels to sifting through the analytics-derived offerings of video streaming services, for instance. But the television docket’s always been dominated by ratings considerations; that choice is no less of an illusion than in the entertainment model that superseded it. From the emergence of transmitted media, representation became subsidiary to television’s replicability into every home. In 1969, a group of Indigenous Americans calling themselves Indians of All Tribes occupied the island of Alcatraz. Among their number was a young Ogala Lakota from Yellow Thunder camp named Russell Means. The following year, inspired by the media attention the Alcatraz protest received, Means led a group of radical activists from the American Indian Movement in capturing the Mayflower II, a replica of the original ship built in the 1950s. Unlike the Alcatraz action, which seized on an element of property law that if the government land had no resident, it could be bought back by its original inhabitants, the taking of the Mayflower II was a symbolic gesture. What Means understood well, and what set him apart from his fellow organizers, was that through television, the Mayflowers could be merged in the public consciousness in a grand redirection of history. Viewers would watch the capture of the ship as if it had happened in 1620. In television’s replicability, we find the seeds of quantification in our current cultural configuration. The question of who frames the media’s view of reality is as urgent now as it was then. Just as a curler’s skill is only as good as their skip’s stratagem, the agency of the individual to select the boundaries plays a significant role in a satisfying rearrangement of the equation.</p>
		<p>Recently, a dominant trend in art has been towards engaging with the prominent crises of modern life in what is essentially a literary manner, or more explicitly, by thematizing the issue. This is the natural extension of a quantified culture, where meaning is named, charted, and compartmentalized. In the accumulation of artistic production addressing a certain issue, it can be said that awareness is raised. Means brought public attention to the economic and social barriers facing indigenous Americans, not by reclaiming communal spaces, but by replicating a counter-perspective on history. But while the past half-century has seen great strides in the pluralism of viewpoints, the spaces those viewpoints have left to occupy are disappearing in number. Art concerned with the immediacy of experience has taken the tailback’s place in the defense and is too often reduced to squeakily begging for its tuppence.</p>
	   <p>It would be dangerous to interpret the need for immediacy as a call for individualism to gawkily return from its place in the past. If the individual is invoked, it is to acknowledge how lonely we have become, and impoverished of new connections. The way we navigate the city is rapidly restructuring again, and one would be (for instance) nonplussed to one day find schuyts on the canals of New Amsterdam. Our government might regard the entirety of New York as a lawless zone and foment fear amongst the general public, but in truth we are safer to move around the city than ever before. We should take advantage of this freedom while we can, because the time left before our navigation is restricted by environmental factors is in question. The Dutch have developed a strategy for flood management based on the concept of meebewegen, or “living with water.” This strategy runs the opposite direction from civil engineering, adopting an adapt-or-flight model to coastal surges that may prove difficult to implement. So far, public backlash has been difficult to smoothe over on this "Accomodate-Retreat" plan, but the question may not be whether those measures will be necessary, but when. Humanity faces inundation on a number of fronts that will soon make concerns about the flood of information seem like flummeries.</p>
	   <p>One sea-change that is here already is the pervasive tracking of personal data, despite claims by company executives that their practices conform to pre-existing practices of market surveys and elective participation. These policies elide consent by becoming omnipresent; if surveillance becomes an inescapable fixture of life, agreement or nonagreement to the terms of service is perfunctory. Business journalist Shoshana Zuboff uses the term “behavioral surplus” to describe user data that is collected as a by-product of services rendered by tech companies. “For all of the elaborate ways in which surveillance capitalists labor to render reality as behavior for surplus, the simplest and most profound is their ability to know exactly where you are all the time. Your body is reimagined as a behaving object to be tracked and calculated for individual search.” A direct line can be drawn between tracking movement and tracking behavior by making it quantifiable across geographic coordinates. Our devices are the mobile cutlings of the bleeding edge, adapting to patterns of individual use and preferences with the implicit aim of identifying customers. This tacit stalking puts an entrenchment of our behavior in the stepladders’ reach, remarketing it back to us as copilots and virtual assistants. Such inconsiderateness’s impact can only end in a behavioral closed loop, where personal habits undergo greater degrees of systemization. As theorized by Hayles, the forebrain from within and without takes on the characteristics of a computer once its movements and preferences are reducible to encoded habits. In a networked society, this data can be easily scauped for control and profit.</p>
	   <p>“The stakes are high in this market frontier,” observes Zuboff, “where unpredictable behavior is the equivalent of lost revenue.” Randomness, then, is opposed to predictability, but is only available as an operation of a post-quantification culture. This relationship between constraints and chance lends itself particularly well to gamification, but in a way that differs from the gamification procedures used by marketers. This dialectic is exemplified by the deeply influential 1980s UNIX game Rogue. Other role-playing games and "dungeon crawlers" of the time designed levels in advance, which Rogue's designers argued made subsequent playthroughs after beating the game predictable and boring. In contrast, the layout of each room and the placements of each item and monster in Rogue are random, making no two levels alike. Because pure randomness would result in some levels that were technically unbeatable, the game’s developers employed a procedurally generated structure, imposing constraints on each level's geometry to prevent unwinnable situations. One consequence of this, however, was that not long after the gameplay system’s ratification, programmers began to develop tools that could play the game automatically despite its nonlinear nature, through interpreting its underlying patterns. Even in the absence of actual patterns, humans display the remarkable ability to unconsciously construct some. For instance, individuals with Musical Ear Syndrome (MES) appear to experience the sensation of music due to the absence of auditory stimuli. "Tetris syndrome" describes another form of hallucination wherein a Tetris player begins to organize sensory information from the external world in a similar way to the game’s play structure. Guttiform apparitions are common for those experiencing Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS). Rogue uses the limited text set of the computer for its interface, a limitation that was reflected in the use of written text as gameplay for many early computer games, as in the case of text adventures. The game is a paradigmatic example of artificial software built out of human structures of meaning, using language in its construction in a way that partially ignores but at times acknowledges its semiotic potential. For example, monsters are casually signified by letters, such as an “E” for Emu. Other elements are represented by symbols, like the “@” symbol denoting the player character. This has led to speculation about the sign’s meaning, with some concluding it’s ‘where the player’s at.’ The game’s aleatory design reflects another facet of human unpredictability. This modeling of distinctly human qualities might serve to explain why so many players gravitated toward Rogue at the time, and why enough subsequent games drew explicit influence from it to eventually spawn a new genre, the "roguelike." Some of these camp followers featured more sophisticated graphics, drawing backlash from fans. According to one of the developers of a roguelike game, “[s]ome people were almost openly hostile towards the idea of a graphical frontend."</p>

	   <p>What to paint after the resurgence of genre and the academy? What to paint when art is interpreted according to theme instead of feeling? What to paint when the decisions not made are invisible to others? What to paint when the practitioners of painting are so often cloistered? Anaphoras for an obsolete expression that has incarnated so many undeaths. Painting is too often recused from the conversation because its silence refuses to conform to the rules of discourse. What to paint when anything can be painted? Can anything be painted? What to paint after culture has accelerated to the point where immediacy is mediated from outside the medium? (The latter question also alliterates to highlight the non-rhetorical phonetic qualities giving language its form.) In other words, by virtue of its slowness, painting is unsuited to the crises of the moment. It becomes a tool that loses all specificity in the hands of the literalist, who would address the moment by duplicating in paint the immediacy of more modern media like digital photographs or screenshots. It is no wonder that such a person would celebrate commodification as art's most distinctive feature. Greenberg's flatness could never be painting’s endpoint, because it was self-reflexive. (His judgments were also not self-reflexive about some of their glaring biases.) Painting's subsumption under capital was that endpoint, because that subsumption made the illusion of choice inescapable. A painting reveals truths in the immediate through its singularity. The discontiguities between paintings unbends difference through their commonality. Painting exists outside the human while exhibiting human qualities. It indexes vision and touch with the inextricable and organic plasticity of whalebones—that material most resembling the properties of modern synthetics before their invention.</p>
	   <p>Every Old Master worth remembering held in common a respect for the humbleness of their materials and would often smuggle the casual, the dashed off, the crudely material into their commissioned portraits of noblemen and royals. It is profoundly leveling once noticed at the museum, like how a Brooklyn brownstone now signifies costliness and prestige, when sandstone was originally chosen for its ease of quarrying and carving, not its ability to last. The kings and queens’ grasp of art was akin to their knowledge of royal fishes, the chattel whales and sturgeons; according to Melville, the puritan lawyer William Prynne apportioned the heads of whales to the king and their tails to the queen for her corsetry—curious, because whalebone comes from the head of the whale. Normalizing the contingency of these gestures set art on the path of disestablishing the convention of artists’ studies, making the process of art equal in value to a highly finished work. (It is often the sketches, studies, and unfinished work of artists of the past that reveal the most, like a historical figure’s diary whose value is measured by those observations never meant for public consumption.) Gnaphalioid strokes, variegation, and mistakes are far more interesting left unpulled from the garden; it is from them that art draws its richness and vitality. To say that an artwork needs fixing is to treat it as a problem that requires solving.</p>
	   <p>Creation is an act of nuance that involves seeing the work of art in several different registers and being able to jump freely between them. In language, this is referred to as code switching, the process by which we all adopt different forms of address depending on social context. To see meaning as a lorry’s cargo waiting to be unpacked is to impoverish it. Despite the grumblings of subjectivists, accepting an artwork’s meaning as polyvalent is accepting it as an object of sophistication and complexity. This property is embedded in Christian mysticism; to ignore the Western painting tradition’s ontological overtones is to never truly understand it. A work of art is like the hazelnut that is shown to Julian in her first revelation; put linguistically, it is both taxeme and lexicon. It exists as three simple properties: it is made, it is appreciated, and it lasts. Julian has a vision of Mary in her pubescence, and the Virgin’s relationship to the Creator is explicitly channeled through her role as a beholder:</p>
	   <center><p><em>Also God shewid in party the wisedam and the trueth of hir soule, wherein I understood the reverend beholding that she beheld hir God and maker, mervelyng with greate reverence that he would be borne of hir that was a simple creature of his makeyng.</em></p></center>
	   <p>From this example, we can draw an important conclusion about the creative act. An artist creates through the beholder and also creates the beholder at the same time.</p>
	   <p>The Renaissance brought with it a renewed interest in nature as a conduit for devotion, and saw great advancements in figurative art developed from observation of the natural world. But many of these conventions, like graphical perspective, were abstractions derived from mathematics in an attempt to make nature predictable and reproduce it across a two-dimensional plane. The more we familiarize ourselves with the ways artists work from observation, the more memesis seems to be about the distance between the template and its interpretation. It is a persistent bugfish of software engineers that computers can not actually generate true random numbers, only approximate them via transfers from a dataset like atmospheric noise or radioactive decomposition. This can be an incredibly slow process, so the speed and efficiency-obsessed computing sector developed pseudo-randomness as an answer. The appeal of pseudo-random number generation is its speed and reproducibility, but the principle that an algorithm can in theory produce the same random result twice is complicated considerably by the fact that equations do not always act predictably. A univariate normal distribution is sampled using floating point arithmetic, which is notorious for its many esoteric ways of being inaccurate. More complex still, generating random vectors from a multivariate normal distribution necessitates matrix decomposition using gaussian elimination. In the past, this kind of large-scale matrix decomposition could be spread across multiple processors using MUMPS’s software. Accessible LANs have given way to lonely WANKs as the internet extends further outward to the global south in search of cheap energy. For our purposes, though, randomness will have to remain a pure concept, as alien to cubes of sand as to colored mud (with the perilous exception of some dichroic glazes). Only a hyperpurist would want to completely eradicate indeterminability, to ensure every generation reproducible.</p>
	   <p>Once the reader has cleared the elvers’ pass of this essay’s title, it is necessary to point out some of the assumptions surrounding algorithms held by the public, much of which comes from the widespread misuse of the term. Being merely sequences of mathematical operations, algorithms are not responsible for the quantification in all levels of our lives. As companies enact policies that strip users of privacy and choice, we seem to suffer from an anosognosia that prevents us from identifying the human culprits of these power grabs, and instead blame them on abstract projections. In fact, we should encourage the invention of satisfying dedicated equations that model human qualities as a way of negotiating the accumulation of information. We are being made to resit the same tests of our ignorance with machine learning. Do we now give up on the mere idea of undoing the restructuring of our patterns of behavior?</p>
	   <p>Too often for artists, idea precedes execution: the final result becomes little more than the outsourcing of the intellect to the material world. Therein lies the importance of making the thinking process a dynamic and active part of the developing work. Because the artist creates too through the beholder, completion is not a deterministic proposition. Far from being immaterial, process is the petiolate that branches an idea off from its instantiation. While there will always be the risk that the experience of the work of art in its singularity might outperform its concept, the piece that takes new direction with each reenvisioning it inspires will bear the markings of a hard-won arrival at something more than its sum. Like a selector spinning something unplanned to satisfy the mood of the crowd, such work is more responsive to the demands of its time than the seasonable gimmick. There could hardly be a more inappropriate tool to address the incessant drive to turn everything into information than painting, but its iterative, slow responsiveness to the needs of the immediate—not the state of temporal acceleration we are currently experiencing, but the spatial immediacy of what is sensorially closest—could prove ideal to expiate for our feeling of lost presentness.</p>
